## Introduction

During my summer holiday, in between long walks and nice food & drinks, I felt
like writing some code for fun. Unfortunately, I didn't bring my laptop.
Luckily, [Mike Fikes](https://twitter.com/mfikes) created a [ClojureScript REPL
for mobile devices](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/replete/id1013465639) to
write some Clojure(script) without a laptop close at hand.

A REPL, or a Read Eval Print Loop, reads your input, evaluates it, prints the
result and waits for new inputs to read. In the meantime, the code you wrote
lives in REPL memory. So if I define a function in the REPL, it will be read and
evaluated and in my next input I can call this function, because it lives in
REPL space.

So, back to this REPL on my phone. Permanently saving work is not possible in
this REPL, there are no debugging capabilities, no code completion, no test
runners ... just a REPL: 35 characters wide in portrait mode, 79 characters wide
in landscape mode. To give you an idea of my 'Integrated Development
Environment' and the resulting mazes, I recorded a 30 seconds screen cast:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/286153487" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

At home, I created a gist containing all 70 lines of [maze
code](https://gist.github.com/mmzsource/ee88b93a3829f98fcb6188f2f2162fcf) (56
lines according to the command-line tool cloc). In this blog I'm going to explain
the concepts and code.

## Grids, Cells and Neighbours

First of all, we'll need a grid and a coordinate system to point to individual
cells in the grid. The reason is that most maze generators expect to be able to
traverse a grid and lookup information about cells and neighbours of cells.

A grid can be modeled as a vector of vectors, representing rows and columns:

```Clojure
(def grid
  [[1 2 3]
   [4 5 6]
   [7 8 9]])
```

A cell can be pinpointed by its [row col] coordinate which matches perfectly
with the `get-in` function in clojure. This `get-in` function is used to find
items in nested data structures. For instance, `(get-in grid [2 1])` will result
in the value `8`.

To find the neighbours of a cell, I created a couple of helper functions:

```Clojure
(defn north-of [[row col]] [(dec row) col])
(defn south-of [[row col]] [(inc row) col])
(defn west-of  [[row col]] [row (dec col)])
(defn east-of  [[row col]] [row (inc col)])
```

The function argument is destructured (taken apart and named) and the
`north-of`, `south-of`, `west-of` or `east-of` neighbour coordinate is
calculated by `inc`rementing or `dec`rementing the row or column number. For
instance, `(north-of [1 1])` results in the value `[0 1]`.

Using the `juxt` function we can now calculate all neighbours in one go. `juxt`
takes a variable number of functions as arguments and returns a new function.
This new function returns a vector containing the result of applying each
function to the arguments provided. So for instance `((juxt north-of south-of
west-of east-of) [1 1])` results in the value `[[0 1] [2 1] [1 0] [1 2]]`.

Unfortunately, these functions don't care about the grid. `((juxt north-of
south-of west-of east-of) [0 0])` will happily return `[[-1 0] [1 0] [0 -1] [0
1]]` containing cell coordinates inside AND outside the grid. Therefore, in
order to calculate all neighbours **in** the grid, we need to filter out the
ones that are not part of the grid. This results in the following `neighbours`
function:

```Clojure
(defn neighbours [grid cell]
  (filter #(get-in grid %) ((juxt north-of south-of west-of east-of) cell)))
```

## Mazes and Cells

Now working with the grid is easy, let's move on to the maze. A maze is
basically a grid, augmented with some information to determine if borders
between cells are open or closed. That information can be easily stored in the
cells themselves.

I liked the approach [Mark
Bastian](http://fn-code.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-maze-ing-mazes-with-clojure.html)
took: in a cell, simply list the coordinates of neighbours the cell is connected
to. We can even list the coordinates in a set `#{}`, since duplicating neighbour
coordinates is useless. A 2x2 'maze' with all borders closed looks like this:

```Clojure
[[#{} #{}]
 [#{} #{}]]
```

A 2x2 'maze' with an open border between the 2 cells on the left looks like this:

```Clojure
[[#{[1 0]} #{}]
 [#{[0 0]} #{}]]
```

The two connected cells reference each other. It would be convenient to have a
function that updates the grid when a border needs to be removed between 2
cells:

```Clojure
(defn remove-border [grid c1 c2]
  (-> grid
      (update-in c1 conj c2)
      (update-in c2 conj c1)))
```

## Maze Generation

Now it's time for the maze generation. Luckily I had a copy of the ['Mazes for
Programmers
book'](https://www.amazon.com/Mazes-Programmers-Twisty-Little-Passages/dp/1680500554)
on my phone. Because I like the texture of the mazes coming out of the recursive
backtracker algorithm, I decided to implement that one.

The algorithm can start on any cell on the grid and I decided to start on `[0
0]` every single time. Every cell that is visited by the algorithm is pushed on
a stack which I have called the `backtrackstack`. The cell on top of the stack
is considered the current cell.

From the current cell, a path is created (`remove-border`) to a randomly
selected, previously unvisited neighbour. An unvisited neighbour can easily be
detected, since it's simply an empty set `#{}`. That previously unvisited cell
(`next` in my code) is also pushed unto the stack. This process repeats
continuously until a cell is visited that has no unvisited neighbours. At that
point, that dead-end cell is popped of the stack, making the previous cell the
current cell. Again, the algorithm will check if this cell has unvisited
neighbours and will either create a path to that unvisited neighbour or pop
another cell from the `backtrackstack`. This will continue until every cell has
been visited and the `backtrackstack` is empty.

```Clojure
(defn find-unvisited-neighbours [grid cell]
  (let [n (neighbours grid cell)]
    (filter #(empty? (get-in grid %)) n)))

(defn generate-maze [rows cols]
  (loop [maze           (create-grid rows cols)
         backtrackstack '([0 0])]
    (if (empty? backtrackstack)
      (print-maze maze)
      (let [unvn (find-unvisited-neighbours maze (first backtrackstack))]
        (if (empty? unvn)
          (recur maze (rest backtrackstack))
          (let [next (rand-nth unvn)]
            (recur
             (remove-border maze (first backtrackstack) next)
             (conj backtrackstack next))))))))
```

Fingers crossed:

```Clojure
 (generate-maze 4 4)

[[#{[1 0]} #{[0 2]} #{[0 3] [0 1]} #{[1 3] [0 2]}]
 [#{[0 0] [2 0]} #{[2 1] [1 2]} #{[1 1] [1 3]} #{[2 3] [0 3] [1 2]}]
 [#{[1 0] [3 0]} #{[2 2] [1 1]} #{[2 1] [3 2]} #{[3 3] [1 3]}]
 [#{[2 0] [3 1]} #{[3 0] [3 2]} #{[2 2] [3 1]} #{[2 3]}]]

 (generate-maze 4 4)

[[#{[0 1]} #{[0 0] [0 2]} #{[1 2] [0 1]} #{[1 3]}]
 [#{[1 1] [2 0]} #{[1 0] [1 2]} #{[1 1] [0 2]} #{[2 3] [0 3]}]
 [#{[1 0] [2 1]} #{[2 0] [3 1]} #{[2 3]} #{[2 2] [3 3] [1 3]}]
 [#{[3 1]} #{[3 0] [2 1] [3 2]} #{[3 3] [3 1]} #{[2 3] [3 2]}]]

 (generate-maze 6 4)

[[#{[1 0]} #{[0 2]} #{[0 3] [0 1]} #{[1 3] [0 2]}]
 [#{[0 0] [2 0]} #{[2 1] [1 2]} #{[1 1] [1 3]} #{[2 3] [0 3] [1 2]}]
 [#{[1 0] [3 0]} #{[1 1] [3 1]} #{[3 2]} #{[3 3] [1 3]}]
 [#{[2 0] [3 1]} #{[3 0] [2 1]} #{[2 2] [4 2]} #{[4 3] [2 3]}]
 [#{[4 1] [5 0]} #{[4 0]} #{[4 3] [5 2] [3 2]} #{[3 3] [4 2]}]
 [#{[5 1] [4 0]} #{[5 2] [5 0]} #{[4 2] [5 3] [5 1]} #{[5 2]}]]
```

Nice! Now the only thing left is printing a more human friendly view of this
maze.

## Maze Printing

First, the top of the maze is printed:

```Ascii
`+---+---+---+`
```

Then, for every row the left border is printed `|` and 2 passes over the cells
have to be made. The first pass determines if there should be a border between
the current cell and its `east-of` neighbour, resulting in something like this:

```Ascii
+---+---+---+---+
|           |   |
```

The second pass over the row adds a `+` and then determines if there should be a
border between the current cell and its `south-of` neighbour, for instance
resulting in this:

```Ascii
+---+---+---+---+
|           |   |
+---+---+   +   +
```

After repeating this for all rows, a maze like this is printed:

```Ascii
+---+---+---+---+
|           |   |
+---+---+   +   +
|       |       |
+   +   +---+   +
|   |       |   |
+   +---+   +   +
|       |       |
+---+---+---+---+
```

The code:

```Clojure
(defn east-open-border? [maze cell]
  (contains? (get-in maze (east-of cell)) cell))

(defn south-open-border? [maze cell]
  (contains? (get-in maze (south-of cell)) cell))

(defn print-cell-body [maze cell]
  (if (east-open-border? maze cell)
    "    "
    "   |"))

(defn print-cell-bottom [maze cell]
  (if (south-open-border? maze cell)
    "   +"
    "---+"))

(defn print-maze [maze]
  (let [result (atom [])
        rows   (range (count maze))
        cols   (range (count (get-in maze [0])))]
    (swap! result conj "+" (repeat (count cols) "---+") "\n")
    (doseq [row rows]
      (swap! result conj "|")
      (doseq [col cols]
        (swap! result conj (print-cell-body maze [row col])))
      (swap! result conj "\n" "+")
      (doseq [col cols]
        (swap! result conj (print-cell-bottom maze [row col])))
      (swap! result conj "\n"))
    (println (s/join (flatten @result)))))
```

Finally, we can print all the mazes we want:

```Clojure
(generate-maze 4 4)

+---+---+---+---+
|   |           |
+   +   +   +---+
|   |   |       |
+   +---+---+   +
|   |       |   |
+   +   +   +   +
|       |       |
+---+---+---+---+

(generate-maze 4 4)

+---+---+---+---+
|       |       |
+---+   +   +   +
|   |   |   |   |
+   +   +---+   +
|   |       |   |
+   +---+   +   +
|               |
+---+---+---+---+

(generate-maze 8 18)

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |               |   |       |                   |       |           |
+   +   +   +---+   +   +   +   +   +---+   +---+   +   +   +---+---+   +
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |       |   |   |           |           |   |
+   +---+   +   +   +   +   +---+---+   +   +---+---+---+---+---+   +   +
|       |   |       |   |   |           |           |   |           |   |
+---+   +   +   +---+   +   +   +---+---+   +---+   +   +   +---+---+   +
|   |       |   |       |   |   |       |   |       |       |           |
+   +---+---+   +   +   +   +   +   +   +---+   +---+   +---+   +   +   +
|           |   |   |   |       |   |           |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+   +---+---+   +   +   +   +---+   +---+---+---+   +   +   +   +   +   +
|   |           |   |       |       |   |           |   |       |   |   |
+   +   +---+---+---+---+   +   +---+   +   +---+   +   +---+   +   +   +
|   |   |               |   |       |   |       |   |       |   |   |   |
+   +   +---+   +---+   +---+---+   +   +---+   +   +---+   +---+   +   +
|               |                   |           |                   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

## Conclusion

So there you have it: a maze generator in ~ 30 lines of code with a 30 lines of
code ascii view on top of it, build with nothing but a REPL on a phone. I really
enjoyed the puzzle and the small (and large) successes while working in the
REPL. I hope you enjoyed this recap.

I'd like to thanks [Mike Fikes](https://twitter.com/mfikes) for his excellent
ClojureScript REPL, [Mark Bastian](https://twitter.com/mark_bastian) for the
inspiration for the maze data structure, [Jamis Buck](https://twitter.com/jamis)
for his lovely 'Mazes for programmers' book and [Gert
Goet](https://twitter.com/gertgoet) for reviewing an earlier version of this
blog. Faults and not-so-idiomatic Clojure code remaining are my own.

Back home, I'm happy to be working in Emacs with the excellent Clojure CIDER
plugin again. Which reminds me that during my holiday I visited a picturesque
CIDER factory in France. Cheers!
