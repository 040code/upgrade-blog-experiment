A short post to share the slides and examples I used in my talk at the [GeeCON](https://2017.geecon.cz) conference on October the 19th in Prague.

## Slides
Below the slides that I for the talk, the slides are available as well on [GitHub](https://npalm.github.io/graphql-slides-20171019/). You can easy navigate through the slides with the spacebar.

To get started with GraphQL the best starting points are:
- [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org)
- [Awesome GraphQL](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql)

## Examples
During the talk, I demonstrated GraphQL via [graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/), which is cloud service for creating a flexible GraphGL backend. I modelled a basic model of a Talk and Person with relation speakers and visitors on graphcool. Furthermore, I modelled two basic sample implementations of a GraphQL backend in Java and JavaScript that are available via GitHub. Those implementation are more limited than the online one, but both serve the following minimal queries.

Query for the name and the title of the talks given by all persons:
```
{
  persons {
    name
    talks {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

And secondly, a query for all titles of talks with their speaker's names.
```
{
  talks {
    title
    speakers {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### JavaScript sample
The JavaScript [sample](https://github.com/npalm/graphql-js-demo.git) is based on [Apollo GraphQL tutorial kit](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-starter-kit).

```
git clone https://github.com/npalm/graphql-js-demo.git
cd graphql-js-demo
yarn && yarn start
```
Instead of yarn, you can use `npm install && npm start`. Once started, browse to [http://localhost:8080/graphiql](http://localhost:8080/graphiql) and play around with the GraphQL web interface. Implementing the JavaScript version was straightforward due to the many examples and good tutorials around.


### Spring Boot Java sample
The Spring Boot Java [sample](https://github.com/npalm/graphql-java-demo.git) is based on the Spring Boot Starter available for GraphQL and GraphQL java tools lib with schema first support.

```
git clone https://github.com/npalm/graphql-java-demo.git
git checkout nextbuild
cd graphql-java-demo
docker build -t graphql-java-demo && docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 graphql-java-demo
```
Alternatively, you can build and run via gradle. Once started, browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to play around with the GraphQL web interface.

Many languages already have support, so feel free to try out your favourite language. Currently the support on JavaScript looks like by far the best.
